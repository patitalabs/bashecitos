## Why bashecitos? 

A _bache_ in Spanish [from Mexico?], means _pothole_. And they are very famous in the hometown, [LA Tierrita](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ensenada_(Baja_California)). Not something to be proud of, but a way to put humor into something that has not been fixed in years, in the hometown ðŸ˜„. So, in a way with _bashecitos_, we are trying to make things a bit better in our day-to-day lives, while having some fun. 

Also, in LA Tierrita, the pronunciation of _ch_ would sound like: _sh_ is pronounced in other cities in Mexico. For example: ocho, would sound like _osho_, and _ochenta y ocho_, would sound like _oshenta y osho_. Not the official way to pronounce, from what we've have heard, but hey! We understand each other ðŸ˜…

LA Tierrita is an amazing place, and we would really recommend a visit! ðŸ’™
